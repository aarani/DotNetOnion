# F# Coding Style

* For formatting/indentation, please use fantomas v4.4.0-alpha-008 (we will
upgrade soon to a stable version). We even check this at the CI level so we
recommend you to install fantomas in a git pre-commit hook.
* For the rest of style not covered by fantomas, please refer to this document:
